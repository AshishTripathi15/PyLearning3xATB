# 1. Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

num = 2
sq = num ** 2
print(sq)

c = num ** 3
print(c)

num = 2
print(f"Square of {num} is {sq}", f"Cube of {num} is {c}")

num = 2
print((num ** 2),"\n",(num ** 3))


# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

x = 49
y = 78
print (x > y)
print (x < y)
print (x == y)
